A web app combining data from the Eventfinda and AT Hop Api's.

Our idea was to create a hub of information in which people could access data about events in their area as well valuable transport information.
DirectEvent's transport info shows the best bus routes to get to, and parking spaces around, the event to provide greater accessibility for any mode of transport.
